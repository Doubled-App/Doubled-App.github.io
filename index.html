		<p>Doubled was inspired by 2048, but built with entirely new game mechanics. Combine only the tiles that you swipe together. How high can you get? </p>
		<p>Take on the game in one of two different game modes. Casual mode for those who want to take their time, and Time Attack for those who want to really test their skill. Get your high score and make it to the top of the leaderboards! You can keep your high score synced across all of your devices with iCloud. View all of your game information in the statistics page to see things such as your total cumulative score across all your games.</p>
		<p>Available for iPhone and iPad, and coming soon to Android.</p>
